# Object Detection Result Viewer

This Python script uses the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module to open and display the original image and the resulting image from an object detection process. The script is designed to be used with the `man_cafe.jpg` image and assumes that the object detection process has generated a resulting image at the path `./runs/detect/exp/man_cafe.jpg`.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install pillow
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the `man_cafe.jpg` image in the same directory as this script or update the path in the code to the location of your `man_cafe.jpg` image.

2. Run the script using the following command:
   ```
   python object_detection_viewer.py
   ```

3. The script will open two images:
   - The original image (`man_cafe.jpg`)
   - The resulting image from the object detection process (`./runs/detect/exp/man_cafe.jpg`)

## Note

- The object detection process should have generated the resulting image at the specified path (`./runs/detect/exp/man_cafe.jpg`) before running this script. If the file is missing or named differently, the script may not work as expected.
