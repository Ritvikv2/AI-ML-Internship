# Official Age and Gender Detection

<h2>Objective :</h2>
<p>To build a gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) in a picture or through webcam.</p>

<h2>About the Project :</h2>
<p> During this python Project, I hve used Deep Learning tools such as OpenCV and Darknet to identify gender and age of a single/multiple people using face detection. I used the existing trained models by <a href="https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/Adience/Adience-data.html">Tal Hassner and Gil Levi</a>. 

<h2>Dataset :</h2>
<p>For this python project, I had used the Adience dataset; the dataset is available in the public domain and you can find it <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ttungl/adience-benchmark-gender-and-age-classification">here</a>. This dataset serves as a benchmark for face photos and is inclusive of various real-world imaging conditions like noise, lighting, pose, and appearance. The images have been collected from Flickr albums and distributed under the Creative Commons (CC) license. It has a total of 26,580 photos of 2,284 subjects in eight age ranges (as mentioned above) and is about 1GB in size. The models I used had been trained on this dataset.</p>
